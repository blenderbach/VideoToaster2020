# VideoToaster2020
We're porting data from the original VideoToaster!

Back in 2020, I began porting data from the original VideoToaster for the Commododore Amiga to our modern world. 
Please, feel free to use and modify these things a you wish, but please, credit me. I worked very hard to do this. 
I had to go through a lot of technical difficulties to get to the point where I am today.

If you use these, please put "***VideoToaster Effects Ported By: Blender Bach***" in your video's credits or YouTube description. 
This will help more people find this.

Most importantly, enjoy these effects, ported by me, Blender Bach.

***INFO***

***Folders with an "Unextractable.txt" file, are effects that I haven't been able to extract, yet.***

***Folders with a "Partially Extractable.txt" file, are effects that I managed to extract, but had to edit them slightly, increasing brightness and contrast, to make them visible.***

***Folders with no ".txt" file, are effects that I managed to extract with no editing.***
